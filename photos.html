        Hi, i just want u to know na i wanna stay, 
        kahit gaano pa kahirap kahit gaano kasakit, 
        i'll STAY. I just hope one day u'll realized 
        that LOVE doesn't mean pushing away the 
        person who love u who care's about you. 
        If staying means having u in my life, 
        i won't hesitate to stay. I wanna be with u 
        in your happiest days and especially in your 
        worst. Pero if having me in your life means 
        having problems or even make u mad. 
        Hindi kita pipilitin na magstay. I don't 
        wanna be the one na papahirapin ang buhay mo. 
        I just want you to know, i'll do my best to love 
        you, I'll stay even in your worst days. Just tell 
        me if you wanna be loved by me.
    </p>
